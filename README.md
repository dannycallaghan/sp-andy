# Andy

Repo for things we will cover/create in our sessions. The main branch is, and should be, empty. There'll be a new branch created for each topic.

## Branches

- 01-vanilla-reactold-reactnew

What is a JavaScript application? Use vanilla to create an application, then recreate it using React class components, and React functional components.


- 02-why-react

Our React app is slower to render than our vanilla, so why is React so popular?
